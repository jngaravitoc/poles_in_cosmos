## Data 

This folder contains the data used in this project. 
In the `orbits/` folder the orbits of the MW-LMC idealized simulations are located. 
The files correspond to: 

LMC3 corresponds to LMC1 in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05089]{Garavito-Camargo+19} 
LMC4 corresponds to LMC2 in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05089]{Garavito-Camargo+19}
LMC5 corresponds to LMC3 in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05089]{Garavito-Camargo+19}
LMC6 corresponds to LMC4 in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05089]{Garavito-Camargo+19}

In the `m12_satellte_indices` folder the indices of the most massive mergers from z 0-1 of the m12 latte
halos are located. Dark Matter indices are denoted by `dm_inds.py` while the stars indices are 
denoted by `new_z0_inds.npy`. These indices where obtained by E. Cunningham.
