## Correlation function computation 

Correlation function analysis is computed with the `correlation_function_particle.py` script which can be run with the `corrfunc.sh` bash script or with 
the `corrfunc_rusty.sh` in an HPC cluster.

The script runs in parallel by just specifying the number of `threads` needed.  
The input parameters are: `init_snap`, `final_snap` and `nthreads`. 

Output:
