Reviewer #1:

The manuscript studies the effect the accretion of satellite galaxies has on the
orbital pole distribution of different tracers (dark matter and star particles,
and subhalos) around host galaxies. It uses seven cosmological zoom simulations
of Milky-Way mass from the Latte suite, focussing on only two hosts in detail:
one with a massive, one wit a low-mass satellite merger. Figures for the other
five hosts are provided in an appendix. A main result is that the infall of a
massive satellite induces clustering in orbital poles also in a full
cosmological context, in line with previous idealized simulations. This is
interpreted to be analogous to the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud onto the
Milky Way, and thus potentially relevant for the explanation of the observed
rotating satellite plane.

The topic is highly relevant for the current discussion about the origin of
planes of satellite galaxies, and thus expected to be of interest to a broad
range of colleagues working on the Milky Way and its satellite galaxy system.
The manuscript is long and provides details on the used data and the performed
analysis. It discusses the results in depths and draws numerous conclusions.
Overall, this is a very interesting study that is worthy of publication, once a
number of issues have been addressed. These are detailed in the following:

(1) Small sample size of simulations
Generally the authors should be more cautious of interpreting a few, rather
specific cosmological zoom simulation as MW analogs. It is not clear how
applicable these are to the observed case (as the manuscript itself alludes to
in parts), and as such generalizing from the obtained findings for these
specific cases is a major step that is not necessarily fully justified.
To provide an example: from the presented figures, it could also be concluded
that the orbital pole concentration of the 11 brightest satellites is generally
tighter in the case of no massive satellite infall (comparing m12b with m12i,
but also m12m has no massive satellites and relatively clustered poles). While
the pole concentration changes less than in case of an infalling massive
satellite, the clustering is much tighter to begin with and thus closer to the
observed situation. One could thus use the presented results to argue that
having a massive satellite fall into a halo may be detrimental to obtaining very
tightly clustered poles. I encourage the authors to be more careful to balance
their interpretations and be cautious of such alternative ones, given the very
limited dataset available.

(2) Significances
Related to the small sample size is the question of the significance of the
results. In several places throughout the manuscript, the word "significant" or
"significant changes" or similar are used. However, no measures of significances
are provided. This needs to be rectified, as the statements otherwise remain
unsupported.

(3) Mass ratio of m12b:
Simulation m12b is presented as the closest MW-LMC analog and claimed in the
text to have a satellite-to-host mass ratio of 1:5.7. Yet the mass ratio at
infall stated in table 1 is 0.35, or 1:2.9. The number in the text can be
reproduced as the ratio of satellite mass at infall with the total host mass at
z=0, but this compares masses almost half the age of the universe apart in time.
The host mass has increased by 70% since then, which presumably includes the
mass of the accreted satellite which by then will have fully merged with it. The
text thus needs to be updated to state the more meaningful mass ratio at infall.
A 1:3 mass ratio in turn places m12b above current estimated MW-LMC mass ratios,
well into the range of major mergers. This makes it a less convincing analog.
This is also supported by comparing the orbit evolution in m12b and the
idealized simulations, where the former orbit decays much more quickly, likely
due to the higher degree of dynamical friction because of the high-mass
satellite. This caveat needs to be clearly communicated, as it is likely that
the effect of such a high-mass satellite are considerably stronger than those to
be expected by the LMC.
How does this compare to the recent publication by Kanehisa et al. (2023)
studying the effect of major mergers on satellite galaxy planes in a
cosmological context, finding no strong evidence?
Note also that the reported mass ratios in Table 1 do not exactly match with
those computed using M_host and M_sat, and the differences appear to be more
than just rounding errors.

(4) Applicability to observed MW satellite system:
How do the presented results change if only distances up to 150 and 200 kpc are
considered? The observed MW satellites for which co-rotation along the satellite
plane is well established are mostly in the inner regions of the considered
distance range of 50-300 kpc, due to the increasing proper motion errors for
more distant satellites. In contrast, the investigated effect is expected to be
strongest for the most distant tracers. Note also that the upper distance limit
of 300 kpc extends well beyond the virial radii of the considered simulated
hosts at their satellite infall times.
When discussing Pawlowski et al. (2022) in Sect. 2, the focus is on
idealizations of the numerical model. However, their work also looked at the
actual observed MW satellites and found the proposed reflex-motion and
centroid-shift induced orbital pole clustering to be an untenable explanation
for the degree of observed clustering (especially in light of the velocities of
the observed satellites). The expected shift in center of mass and the expected
shift in velocity do not appear sufficient to substantially change the orbital
pole directions for observed the on-plane satellites. This should be mentioned
as a caveat for applying the simulations' results to the observed system.
Another difference with the analysis of the observed MW satellite system is that
the present study uses dark matter or star particles as tracers. This heavily
weights the orbital pole analyses by mass (a massive satellite will have more
particles). In contrast, orbital poles of MW satellites are typically not
weighted, but each considered equally. Computing the clustering using individual
particles will also introduce a lot of correlated particle pairs, since those
residing in the same subhalo will have very similar orbital poles. Thus the
results based on particle tracers are not easily applicable to the study of
observed satellite galaxies. The manuscript should more carefully differentiate
these approaches, as it currently jumps from inferences based on dark matter
particles to statements about satellite galaxies, e.g. in several places in the
conclusions. For example in the first bullet point, significant changes to the
DM particle orbital poles due to a massive satellite infall are discussed, and
then used to argue that the dynamical state of a galaxy needs to be considered
when interpreting the clustering or satellite galaxy orbital poles. The latter
leap is not fully justified by the presented evidence and limited number of
simulated systems.

(5) Induced co-rotation:
The description of the co-rotation signature is not always complete, which could
confuse the reader and leave them with an incorrect interpretation. See for
example Sect: 5.2. Yes, the differential motion causes a clustering of orbital
poles, but it also requires a shift in position of the central galaxy relative
to the halo. As such, the outer halo does not appear to be co-rotating. To first
order all of the outer halo moves in the same direction relative to the central
galaxy. Yet the outer halo's center is shifted relative to the central galaxy in
such a way that at a given distance from the central galaxy, one side of the
halo has a somewhat higher density. Without this shift, one would have an
enhancement of orbital poles along a great circle, not a rotational signature.
The shift causes the orbital poles on one side of the host to be more numerous
due to the enhanced desnitz at given radius. This produces an overdensity and
apparent rotation signature, but only in the orbital pole distribution. As such,
the text should be revised to make clear that the halo is not rotating, and that
apparent rotation is inferred from the orbital poles only if this density effect
is in place. This also applies in other parts of the manuscript, e.g. the
sentence around line 988: "A key signature of the dipole mode is the co-rotation
in the outer halo as shown in this paper ...".

(6) Figure 4 and related discussion:
It is not sufficiently clear what velocities are shown in the upper panels of
Fig. 4. If this is the absolute velocity relative to the simulation box, how can
it be negative? If it is the difference in velocity between the host at a given
time and its velocity at a later time, again, how can it be negative? If it is
the difference in absolute velocity relative to the simulation box at a given
time and at a later time, I see how this could get negative, but in that case
the total velocity change could be considerably higher than this value because
the direction of motion can change without affecting the absolute value. Please
be more specific in what the underlying calculations are, what is plotted, and
what this provides meaningful information on.
Why does m12b start with a 30 km/s reflex motion already before the massive
satellite is accreted? This appears to contradict the statement on line 576 that
the first pericenter induces a reflex motion of 60 km/s. Only half of that seems
related to the first pericenter, the other half has been in place for a long
time before.
Why is the outer halo velocity measured with subhalos, not the particles?
Doesn't this hinder comparability with the idealized simulations which do not
contain any subhalos?

(7) Coordinate system
Pleaase provide details on the chosen coordinate system for Fig. 5. An
orientation with the plane of the central galaxy only defines one axis, there is
still freedom to rotate along the longitude direction. How was this fixed? In
the discussion of Fig. 5 for m12i, it is suggested that the orbital pole
evolution is related to the passage of this satellite. Could it simply be due to
a re-orientation of the central disk? Since the latter defines the coordinate
system, a disk reorientation would rotate the plotted pattern. Related to this,
how much of the mean orbital pole orientation shown in Fig. 8 is caused by
changes in the coordinate system and thus the orientation of the central disk?

(8) Figure 5 and related discussion:
Please indicate the orbital pole and orbital path of the infalling massive
satellite in these plots, so they are available for comparison in all panels.
Thus far, only at the end of the caption for Fig. 5 the orbital pole direction
is mentioned (but there the values for l and b appear to be swapped).
When discussing M12b, it is stated that the orbital pole distribution is more
isotropic than for the other simulation. A visual impression alone is not
necessarily convincing, can be subective, and thus possibly differ among
readers. Therefore, please support such statements quantitatively. It should
also be mentioned that there appears to be no particular clustering of satellite
orbital poles in the direction of the orbital pole overdensity oriented like the
infalling satellite in the bottom panel for m12b.

(9) Figure 7 and related discussion:
I would like to caution against over-interpreting the shown temporal correlation
as causal. No test of correlation or its significance has been provided. As
such, this remains highly speculative. Yes, some of the enhancements in the
figure seem to be close to the indicated satellite accretion events. However,
there are also cases with considerable enhancement without an indicated
satellite infall. The enhancements sometimes begin before the arrow's position
and sometimes only some time later, and in case of m12w the satellite might even
cause a reduction of orbital pole correlation.

Some other points:
- The statement around line 658 that orbits of subhalos accreted along filaments
  are co-planar needs to be supported by evidence. It also contradicts the
following sentences about a sinusoidal pattern. The latter occurs when subhalos
are accreted from one direction but pass the center of mass on all sides, such
that their orbital poles distribute perpendicular to their infall direction.
This is not at all co-planar, their orbital planes can be inclined by up to 90
degrees.
- Contrary to the statement in the text, at least to me it is obvious from Fig.
  2 that the halo is embedded in more than two filaments. Please clarify and
provide evidence (or refer to a previous work) supporting this statement.
- It is stated in the introduction that the M31 satellite distribution is
  lopsided rather than planar. These two are not mutually exclusive, M31's
satellites appear to be both lopsided globally, and contain a significant planar
subset.

Literature:
The manuscript provides a thorough overview of the related literature. Most of
the relevant publications are included, and mostly discussed appropriately, with
only the following exceptions that should be addressed:
- When discussing the M31 satellite plane, it might be relevant to mention that
  Sohn et al. (2020) measured the first proper motions and found aligned orbital
poles for two members of M31's satellite plane
- The introduction suggests that when accounting for tidal disruption of
  satellites, one finds co-orbiting planes at a 2% probability. The two
references provided for this statement seem to suggest a lower number. Requiring
both planarity and co-rotation, Sawala et al. (2022) report only 1 out of 202
systems to match their MW-analog criteria, i.e. 0.5%. Pham et al. (2022)
explicitly write that when accounting for disruption, the MW satellite system is
a ≈3σ outlier, i.e. around 0.3%. The number given in the introduction thus
appears too high.
- When citing the recent paper by Li et al. (2022) reporting that satellite
  planes around hosts in Local Group like pairs are no more frequent than those
round isolated hosts, it would be approprioate to also cite the earlier study by
Pawlowski & McGaugh (2014) on this exact topic that was omitted in their
publication.
- To be fair and unbiased, the discussion of mechanisms proposed for co-rotation
  pattern in Sect. 6.2 should also mention the well known tidal dwarf galaxy
scenario (some references are already cited in the introduction, but worthy of
repeating here).
- Several of the provided references are to arXiv preprints. Please replace
  these with the references to the proper, peer-reviewed publications.

Clarification and typos
Please proof-read and edit the manuscript carefully, as there are numerous
typos, unclear sentences, and errors in referring to panels in figures. These
include:
- In Sect. 2: "For example, halos with recent accretion events or halos
  accreting massive satellites show stronger dipoles then those predicted from
LMC perturbations". Isn't the LMC a massive satellite being accreted, too?
- Also in Sect. 2: "For example, the dynamics of the MW satellite galaxies is
  well represented by a spherical dark matter." What is this supposed to mean?
What is "spherical dark matter"? If a spherical dark matter halo is meant, it is
not clear in what quantities this represents the satellite system. The observed
spatial distribution is, due to the satellite system's flattening, not exactly
well represented by something spherical.
- In Sect. 4.2, DD(T_infall) is defined as the number of pairs at times after
  z=0. Since the simulations end at z=0, this appears to be a typo? Please
clarify.
- In the caption of Fig. 3, the sentence about the host's disk velocity appears
  to be misplaced, or at least it is unclear what this is supposed to refer to
in those figures.
- In several places, panels are referred to incorrectly. For example line 546
  refers to the left panels for the idealized sims but they are the right ones
in the figure. Please go through the manuscript and correct these. Also, it
would ease comparability and understanding for the reader if the different
simulations would always be presented in the same order (particularly the case
for the figures in the appendix, where the simulations appear to be shown in
different random orders in each figure).
- Line 581: Something is wrong here, "Among all." is not a full sentence. Maybe
  a typo or accidentally deleted content?
- Title of Sect. 6.2: "mater" should be "matter"
- The third bullet point in the conclusion mentions velocity dispersions. This
  seems to be a typo.
