We thank the referee for their thoughtful comments on the second version of our paper. 
We agree with the comments the referee made and made changes in the paper accordingly, 
these are highlighted in red. Below we elaborate more on the changes we made addressing 
all the comments from the referee's report.

We have updated all the analysis in the paper and constrained it to 50-150 kpc to
be closer to what is expected in cosmological simulations. We updated Figures:
5-9 in the main text. We adjust the texts accordingly. In Figure 7 we decided to also 
leave the lines corresponding to 50-300 kpc to compare how much the results change.

We agreed that this is an important clarification to make in the paper. We
included a paragraph in Section 2 (highlighted in red within lines 232-246)
clarifying the previous work done in the literature.

 Thank you for catching this! We have updated the figures and titles accordingly.

We have changed this, thank you!
