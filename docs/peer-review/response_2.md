We thank the referee for their thoughtful comments on the second version of our paper. We also 
apologize for the late response; hopefully, this version of the paper has addressed all comments.
We agree with the comments the referee made and made changes to the paper accordingly, 
which are highlighted in red. In addition, we also updated the discussion of some of the recent paper in the field
after discussions with their authors (these changes are also highlighted in red). Below, we elaborate
 more on the changes we made to address
all the comments from the referee's report.

We have updated all the analysis in the paper and constrained it to 50-150 kpc 
to align more closely with observational studies of the Milky Way. We have updated
the relevant figures in the main text (Figures 5 to 9) and in the Appendix (Figures 13-16).
We have adjusted the texts accordingly (highlighted in red), updating the discussion 
for the studied distance range. Below, we summarize the main changes:

- In Figure 5, the changes mainly concern the density of poles. The distribution of
  poles remains consistent with that from 50-300 kpc due to the limited number of DM
  particles in the outer halo. This is quantified further in Figure 6, where the angular
  correlation function shows changes occurring mainly at the pericentric passages of the
  satellite. In the case of m12b (left panel), the correlation is higher at lower angular
   scales (<20 degrees), contrasting with observations beyond 150 kpc. However,
  quantitatively, the enhancement in the correlation function is similar to the 300 kpc case,
  as shown in Figure 7 for all halos. Although for m12b, the enhancement is higher than
  observed within 300 kpc.

- The main changes are evident in Figure 8, where the mean of the orbital poles is sensitive
  to the chosen distance range. Within the 150 kpc range, we observe that the longitudinal
  poles are closer to zero at t~ 6 Gyrs, but the mean begins to decrease at t=8.6 Gyr when the
   satellite reaches its pericenter. This is consistent with our findings within 300 kpc. Similarly,
  the magnitude and trend of the pole dispersion change, especially for m12i, highlighting that these
   metrics depend on the distance. However, in the case of m12b, the trends remain similar,
   indicating that the effect of a massive satellite is observable across the entire outer halo.

We agreed that this is an important clarification to make in the paper. We
included a paragraph in Section 2 (highlighted in red within lines 232-246)
clarifying the previous work done in the literature. We have also added a paragraph 
in section 5.2.

We agreed that this is an important clarification to make in the paper. We added a 
paragraph in Section 5.3 (highlighted in red within lines 875). Tidal disruption would indeed
be seen in the correlation at the smaller scales. Yet, the temporal changes should be 
gradual and should not have been as strong at the pericentric passages of the satellite.

We update Figure 4 including the COM computed from DM particles. 
Interestingly, there is no net motion at t=6 Gyrs as in the satellites.

 Thank you for catching this! We have updated the figures and titles accordingly.

We have changed this, thank you!
